tr46 - a test to run Unicode 9.0.0 tests against libicu and libidn2+libunistring
================================================================================

IdnaTest.txt downloaded from [here](http://www.unicode.org/Public/idna/9.0.0/IdnaTest.txt).

libidn2 0.11 just supports Unicode 5.2.0.
That is why 1119 out of 15152 tests fail.
